# Project Overview:
An analyis of heart disease data from 1988 using four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to a subset of 14. The "target" field refers to the presence or absence of heart disease in the patient.

1. Topic Selected: Heart Disease predictability 
2. Why: According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 659,000 people in the United States die from heart disease each year or 1 in every 4 deaths.
3. Description: 4 Databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V with 14 columns of predicting factors. 
4. Questions to answer:
    - What are the major predictors of heart disease?
    - What is the gender-specific differences?
    - What risk factors are modifiable?


Preliminary ML Model:
- uses logistical regession to predict target accuracy. 
    - Features: Columns 1-13 (ie. Age, Sex, Chest pain, Cholesterol Level, Fasting blood glucose, etc)
    - Target: Column 14 (ie. Presence of Heart Disease)

Preliminary Database:
- Uses Postgres 

Preliminary Technologies:
- Uses Tableau to display information.
